# Introduction

This design definition file describes the design of the [FuseTS library](https://github.com/Open-EO/FuseTS), 
and the web services derived from it. This library is developed in the frame of ESA AI4Food, and provides algorithms for
integrated timeseries of EO data, as well as timeseries analytics methods.

This design definition file is generated directly from the open source project documentation, which ensures that all
descriptions of modules and functions in this document are completely synchronized with the current state of the software.
As such, this design description is also open source, and thus also serves as a good source of information for potential
users or contributors.
